                FAA Level 2 Award in First Aid for Youth Mental Health 
            </section>
            <p>
                This course is suitable for anyone who actively connects with children such as parents, carers, teachers, youth group leaders and young adults.

                The qualification has been designed with children and young people in mind covering areas such as depression, self-harm, eating disorders and bullying and will provide the knowledge and skills to identify a potential mental health condition, start a conversation, and provide support and guidance to professional help.
                
                
                </p>
                <p>
                Learners will not diagnose or treat mental health conditions as this can only be carried out by healthcare professionals but will gain the knowledge to identify when a person may have a condition and know where they can go to get help.
